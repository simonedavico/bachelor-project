\abstract {

This bachelor project focuses on the design of an automatic tool for data flow coverage computation. Data flow coverage criteria are a promising technique that tracks covered data flow relations in the code to assess the quality of a test suite and to steer test case generation. Data flow criteria have been theorized to be more effective than simpler criteria like statement and branch coverage, but as of today their applicability is limited by the complexity required to compute the coverage measure, that in the lack of automatic tools have to be done manually. 

In this project I designed, developed and tested a component of  an automatic data flow testing tool called \datec, to provide a new efficient tool for computing data flow coverage for java programs.
More specifically, I focused on the implementation of a dynamic runtime monitor component for the coverage computation, and then I carried on the validation activity of the tool verifying its efficiency and correctness.

The result of the project is a efficient a reliable tool, that I am going to release online to help researchers and practitioners experimenting with data flow criteria, since up to now, \datec~is the only available data flow testing tool for object oriented systems.


%Even though they have been discussed in literature for a long time, they are rarely used in practice. Their applicability is limited mostly by their complexity

% and the lack of automated tools for data-flow testing. The main goal of this bachelor project is  to address this concern by developing and evaluating a component for a data-flow testing tool called \datec. More specifically, I focused on the implementation of a dynamic monitor for runtime data-flow coverage computation; on a second time, I verified the tool's efficiency and the correctness of the results with a number of test cases. Results show that the number of test cases required in order to effectively apply data-flow testing  is much greater than the number of test cases required to measure according to more classical criteria, like functional or simpler statement testing criteria.
